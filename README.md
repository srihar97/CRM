## SALESFORCE CRM

1. Introduction
Why: The introduction provides a clear purpose and scope of the CRM system. It defines the features you’ll be building and the technologies you'll use. This step is essential for understanding the goals and setting expectations for the project.

2. System Architecture
•	Why: System architecture gives you a bird’s-eye view of how the system components will interact. It includes:
o	Flowchart: Visual representation of user interaction and how the data flows through the system (Frontend to Backend to Database).
o	Sequence diagram: Shows the step-by-step sequence of events that occur when a user interacts with the CRM (e.g., login, manage projects, submit feedback).
Purpose: This step is essential because it helps in planning and visualizing the system’s interactions. It serves as a blueprint for building each component and ensures smooth integration.

3. Backend Development (Flask)
Step 1: Setting up Flask
•	Why: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that helps you quickly set up a server to handle user requests. You need Flask to process requests from the frontend (e.g., when a user logs in or creates a project). It will manage routing, user authentication, database interactions, and communication with the frontend.
Purpose: Flask handles all backend logic, making it a crucial component for managing the database, authenticating users, and ensuring the smooth functioning of all features.
Step 2: User Authentication
•	Why: User authentication is the process of verifying user identity. This ensures that only authorized users can access the CRM system. You’ll use Flask with libraries like Flask-Bcrypt for hashing passwords and Flask-Login for managing login sessions.
Purpose: Secure login functionality protects user data and ensures that only registered users can access or manipulate CRM data.
Step 3: Project Management
•	Why: The CRM system needs to manage projects and tasks. This involves creating, updating, and viewing projects, which will be stored in the database. Flask will manage these interactions through specific API routes (endpoints) and will handle data validation and database operations.
Purpose: Project management is a core feature of any CRM. It helps users keep track of various projects, ensuring that remote talent can manage work efficiently.
Step 4: Communication Tracking
•	Why: Tracking communication between users or project managers is essential in a CRM to monitor project status and ensure proper updates. Flask will log all interactions, such as comments or updates, into a communication tracking database.
Purpose: This ensures that all stakeholders are aligned and up to date with project details, fostering transparency and accountability.
Step 5: Feedback Mechanism
•	Why: A feedback system allows users to provide ratings and comments on projects. Flask will manage the feedback functionality by creating APIs that handle data input (feedback) and store it in the database.
Purpose: Feedback helps monitor the quality of work and maintain high standards by collecting insights from users.

4. Frontend Development (React)
Step 1: Setting up React
•	Why: React is a popular frontend library for building user interfaces. You will use React to create a dynamic, interactive user experience. It allows the system to respond to user actions without requiring a full page reload (through client-side rendering).
Purpose: React makes it easier to build scalable, maintainable, and responsive web interfaces. This improves the user experience by allowing quick interactions, such as viewing and managing projects, logging feedback, etc.
Step 2: User Interface for Authentication
•	Why: The login and registration forms will be built in React and will communicate with Flask through API calls. This allows users to authenticate themselves and gain access to the system.
Purpose: An intuitive login interface ensures ease of use and guides users into securely accessing the CRM platform.
Step 3: Project Management Interface
•	Why: React will be used to display a dashboard where users can view, create, and manage projects. When a user interacts with the frontend (clicks, submits forms), React will send API requests to the backend to retrieve or update project information.
Purpose: A clean and interactive project management UI allows users to seamlessly track and manage their tasks in real-time, making the CRM system efficient.
Step 4: Communication Tracking Interface
•	Why: Just like project management, tracking communication between team members needs an interface. React will allow users to view logged communications and send updates via forms. These will be processed by Flask and stored in the database.
Purpose: A responsive communication interface ensures that project discussions and updates are easily accessible, keeping users in the loop.
Step 5: Feedback Form
•	Why: Feedback is crucial for evaluating project success and user satisfaction. React will be used to build the form for submitting feedback. This will involve user inputs, like star ratings and comments, which will be sent to the backend via API.
Purpose: Feedback collection helps to maintain a high level of service and ensures continuous improvement.

5. Database Design
Step 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
•	Why: The ER diagram represents the relationships between different data entities (e.g., users, projects, feedback). It will guide you in structuring the database. For example, each project will have a unique ID and will be associated with users and feedback.
Purpose: Database design ensures that data is structured efficiently for fast access and storage. It helps avoid redundancy and ensures relationships between different entities are maintained.
Step 2: Database Schema
•	Why: After designing the ER diagram, you need to create a schema (tables and columns) in your SQL database. The schema will define how data is stored and related.
Purpose: The database schema defines the structure and integrity of the stored data. It ensures that all interactions (e.g., project creation, feedback logging) are performed efficiently and consistently.
________________________________________
6. API Documentation
Step 1: Documenting API Endpoints
•	Why: APIs are the communication bridge between the frontend (React) and backend (Flask). For example, the /login endpoint authenticates users, and /projects fetches project data. Each API should be documented with the necessary input (request) and output (response) formats.
Purpose: API documentation ensures that the frontend knows how to interact with the backend properly. It avoids errors and ensures smooth communication between the two layers.
________________________________________
7. Deployment Strategy
Step 1: Docker
•	Why: Docker will be used to containerize the application. It helps in bundling the entire application (code, dependencies, environment) into a single image that can run consistently across different platforms.
Purpose: Containerization simplifies deployment and ensures that the application runs consistently in different environments (development, testing, production).
Step 2: Heroku or AWS Deployment
•	Why: You’ll need to host the application somewhere. Heroku and AWS are popular hosting platforms that allow you to deploy the application so that users can access it online.
Purpose: Hosting the application makes it accessible to end-users on the internet, allowing them to interact with the system from any location.
Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline
•	Why: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automate testing and deployment whenever you update the codebase. This ensures that every change is validated and deployed without manual intervention.
Purpose: CI/CD ensures efficient, bug-free, and smooth deployment of new features or updates, minimizing human error and reducing downtime.

8. Test Cases
Step 1: Unit Testing for Backend
•	Why: You need to test individual Flask API routes to ensure that each endpoint behaves as expected. Unit testing is critical to verify functionality, detect bugs early, and prevent future issues.
Purpose: Unit testing ensures the backend functions properly, handling all requests, inputs, and outputs as expected.
Step 2: Frontend Testing
•	Why: Testing React components is important to ensure they render correctly and respond to user actions (clicks, form submissions). Tools like Jest can be used to test React components and their state management.
Purpose: Frontend testing helps ensure the user interface is intuitive, functional, and free from bugs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you'll develop a CRM system that’s well-structured, secure, and user-friendly. Each step has a clear purpose, and every action contributes to building a robust and scalable application. The flowcharts and sequencing pipeline in the documentation will provide a detailed visual guide to the entire system’s flow.
